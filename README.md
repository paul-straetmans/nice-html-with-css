# 👌 nice-html-with-css

Lint your HTML by adding a stylesheet to your project. Errors will get an outline style (warning or error). A hint will tell what can be done to fix the issue.

## 💾 Installation

### Manual installation

Insert the distributed css file to your project. Preferrable at the end of your document root.

### Chrome extension

Another option is to use an extension like [User CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb?hl=en) to append the css afterwards in the browser.

## 🎮 Usage

Developers can inspect the warning/error by reading the message in the devtools styles (filter styles for "content").
